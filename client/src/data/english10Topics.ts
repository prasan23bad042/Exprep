<p class="mb-3">The story “His First Flight” is about a young seagull who is afraid to take his first flight. While his two brothers and his sister had already learned to fly, he was still standing alone on the ledge, afraid to move. He lacked confidence and courage, thinking that his wings would not support him if he tried to fly.</p>
<p class="mb-3">His parents encouraged him to fly and even scolded and threatened to leave him hungry if he didn’t. However, he was too frightened to take the plunge. For twenty-four hours, no one came near him. He was left alone, hungry, and helpless. He watched his family flying, diving, and catching fish while he suffered from hunger and shame.</p>
<p class="mb-3">The next morning, his mother noticed him starving on the ledge. To make him fly, she decided to trick him. She took a piece of fish in her beak and flew near him without actually reaching him. The sight of food made the young seagull maddened by hunger, and in his desperation, he dove forward to catch the fish. As he jumped, he fell into space.</p>
<p class="mb-3">At first, he felt terrified, but soon he realized that his wings were supporting him. He began to fly freely in the open air. His fear turned into joy and confidence. He flapped his wings, soared high, and enjoyed the new experience of flying.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Seeing him fly, his parents and siblings rejoiced. They flew around him, praising him and cheering loudly. When he finally landed on the sea, he felt another moment of fear, thinking he would sink. But soon he found that he could float on the water like his family.</p>
<p class="mb-3">At last, the young seagull had made his first flight successfully.</p>

        content: `<p class="mb-3">The poem “Life” by Henry Van Dyke teaches us to live life with courage, hope, and positivity.</p>
<p class="mb-3">The poet wants to live his life year by year, facing the future bravely and cheerfully, without fear or regret.</p>
<p class="mb-3">He says that one should not hurry towards life’s goals, nor run away from them. We should not grieve over the past, because what is gone cannot return. At the same time, we must not fear the future, even if it is uncertain.</p>
<p class="mb-3">Instead, we should live each moment with a happy and thankful heart, accepting both youth and old age as natural parts of life’s journey.</p>
<p class="mb-3">The poet compares life to a journey with ups and downs, rough and smooth paths. No matter how difficult the road becomes, he believes that the journey itself is joyful. He wishes to continue seeking the same things he loved as a boy — new friendships, exciting adventures, and success (the crown).</p>
<p class="mb-3">Finally, the poet says that he will always keep his courage and hope alive, believing that the last turn of life’s road will be the best — meaning that the end of life will bring peace and fulfillment.</p>

<p class="mb-3">The story is a humorous account of a <strong>chaotic night</strong> experienced by the narrator and his family on <strong>November 17, 1915</strong>, when they believe a <strong>ghost</strong> has entered their house. The narrator first hears <strong>strange footsteps</strong> circling the dining-room table and awakens his brother Herman. They investigate, only to find no one, but the footsteps continue, creating fear and confusion. Their mother, alarmed, throws a <strong>shoe through a neighbour’s window</strong> to call for help, which enrages the neighbours, the Bodwells. The police arrive, but the situation worsens when the <strong>grandfather, mistaking them for deserters</strong>, attacks them with a <strong>zither gun</strong>, causing more chaos. In the end, it turns out that the “ghost” was a misunderstanding, and the story humorously portrays the <strong>misadventures, fears, and overreactions</strong> of the family. Thurber highlights <strong>comedy in ordinary life</strong> and the <strong>absurdity of human reactions</strong> to imagined dangers.</p>

The machines then explain their <strong>capabilities</strong>—they can work tirelessly, pull, lift, drive, print, plough, weave, see, hear, count, read, and write, serving humanity continuously.</p>
<p class="mb-3">However, the poem also emphasizes the <strong>limitations of machines</strong>. Despite their strength and abilities, they <strong>cannot love, pity, forgive, or understand lies</strong>, and any human error in handling them can be dangerous. Ultimately, the poem concludes that <strong>machines, no matter how powerful, are creations of the human mind</strong> and depend entirely on humans for direction and purpose.</p>
<p class="mb-3">It is a reflection on the <strong>benefits and risks of technology</strong>, reminding us that machines are tools, not sentient beings.</p>

<p class="mb-3">“The Last Lesson” is set during the <strong>Franco-Prussian War</strong>, when the Prussians occupied Alsace and Lorraine and imposed <strong>German as the medium of instruction</strong>, forbidding French. The story is narrated by <strong>Franz</strong>, a young schoolboy, who realizes the importance of his native language only when he learns that <strong>M. Hamel</strong>, his devoted French teacher, is giving his <strong>final French lesson</strong>.</p>
<p class="mb-3">That morning, Franz is late for school, fearing punishment, but he finds the classroom unusually quiet and solemn. Villagers, including old Hauser and former officials, sit at the back, showing respect for M. Hamel and the French language. The teacher, in his <strong>fine Sunday clothes</strong>, gently tells the students that the order from Berlin mandates <strong>teaching only German</strong> from the next day. This news shocks Franz, making him regret his previous laziness and lack of attention to his studies.</p>
<p class="mb-3">M. Hamel emphasizes the <strong>importance of the French language</strong> as a symbol of identity and freedom, reminding them that losing their language is like losing their country. He patiently teaches the lesson, giving all his knowledge before leaving. The students, as well as the villagers, are deeply moved. During the last moments, M. Hamel writes <strong>“Vive La France!”</strong> on the blackboard, showing his love for his country and language.</p>
<p class="mb-3">The prose highlights <strong>patriotism, the significance of mother tongue, respect for teachers, and the value of education</strong>. It portrays the sorrow of losing one’s cultural identity under oppression and the emotional impact of a teacher’s dedication on his students.</p>

Sitting alone and seemingly empty, the house exudes an eerie presence, with flickering lights at night that make it appear almost alive. Its vast interior is hinted at, yet it remains bare and desolate, creating a sense of emptiness and mystery. The speaker is both curious and fearful, tempted to explore the house but restrained by an instinctive fear of the unknown. The house is accompanied by a strange tree that never changes, remaining leafless and unchanging throughout all seasons, which adds to the unsettling atmosphere. Rumors and stories about the house circulate constantly, yet no one knows the truth about what happened inside, and the house itself appears to slowly fade with time. The poem captures the tension between human curiosity and fear, portraying the house as a symbol of mystery, the unknown, and the lingering power of secrets that may never be uncovered. It emphasizes the allure and danger of things that are beyond understanding, leaving readers with a sense of suspense and unresolved intrigue.</p>
