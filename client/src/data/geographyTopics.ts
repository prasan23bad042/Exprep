    summary: 'India is a vast country located in South Asia, bounded by the Himalayas in the north and surrounded by seas on three sides. It has varied relief features, including the Himalayan mountains, the northern plains, the peninsular plateau, and coastal plains. India\'s major rivers, such as the Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna, and Brahmaputra, form important drainage systems supporting agriculture, industries, and settlements. Islands like the Andamans and Lakshadweep add to India\'s geographical diversity. Its strategic location has influenced trade, culture, and historical interactions with the rest of the world.',

    title: 'Unit 2: Climate and Natural Vegetation of India',
    summary: 'India\'s climate is mainly tropical and is influenced by latitude, altitude, distance from the sea, winds, and monsoons. The monsoon system brings rainfall essential for agriculture, while regions like Rajasthan experience arid conditions and the northeastern states have heavy rainfall. Natural vegetation varies from tropical rainforests in the Andaman and Western Ghats to deciduous forests, mangroves, thorn forests, and alpine vegetation in the Himalayas. Forests provide timber, medicinal plants, and biodiversity, making them crucial for ecological balance and sustainable development.',

    title: 'Unit 3: Components of Agriculture',
    summary: 'Agriculture in India includes subsistence farming, commercial farming, and plantation agriculture. Major crops include rice, wheat, millets, pulses, sugarcane, tea, and coffee. Farming depends on soil types, climate, irrigation, and technology. The Green Revolution in the 1960s increased food production using high-yield varieties, fertilizers, and mechanization. Challenges like small landholdings, soil degradation, and water scarcity continue to affect productivity. Agriculture is not only the primary occupation but also supports agro-based industries and rural livelihoods.',
