    title: 'Unit 1: World War I and Its Aftermath',
    summary: 'The growing demand of capitalist countries for markets and raw materials led to colonial rivalries and conflicts among European powers. Japan rose as an imperial power in Asia, while Europe split into two alliances—the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance. Aggressive nationalism, militarism, and tension in the Balkans caused World War I in 1914. The war ended in 1918 with the Allied victory after the US joined. The harsh Versailles Treaty punished Germany, the Russian Revolution changed global politics, and the League of Nations was formed to maintain peace.',

    title: 'Unit 2: World War II and Its Impact',
    summary: 'The Treaty of Versailles, the Great Depression, and the rise of dictators like Hitler and Mussolini led to another global war. Fascist and Nazi aggression and Japan\'s imperial expansion destabilized world peace. Germany\'s invasion of Poland in 1939 triggered World War II. Key events included the fall of France, Britain\'s resistance, and Japan\'s attack on Pearl Harbor. The war ended in 1945 after the Allied victory and atomic bombings of Japan. It caused vast destruction and loss of life, led to the fall of fascism, and resulted in the creation of the United Nations to ensure world peace.',

    summary: 'After World War II, the world was divided into two major blocs—the capitalist USA and communist USSR—marking the start of the Cold War. Germany was divided, and new alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact emerged. The UN worked for peace and decolonization as Asian and African countries gained independence. The period also saw the rise of communist China under Mao Zedong and the spread of socialist ideologies. Technological growth, space exploration, and the arms race became new dimensions of global rivalry between the superpowers.',

    summary: 'The late 20th century witnessed growing interdependence among nations in trade, technology, and culture. Globalization was driven by rapid communication, transportation, and the rise of multinational corporations. Liberalization policies encouraged foreign investments and global trade. Organizations like the WTO, IMF, and World Bank influenced global economic policies. While globalization improved connectivity and development, it also caused inequality, job loss, and cultural homogenization. Developing countries like India adapted by strengthening their economies and promoting exports and IT industries.',

    summary: 'Resistance to British expansion began even before the 1857 Revolt. Local rulers and people in Tamil Nadu opposed British dominance through several uprisings. The Poligar Rebellions led by Veerapandiya Kattabomman and Maruthu Pandiyars were significant early challenges. The Vellore Mutiny of 1806, one of the first organized revolts, reflected growing anger against British policies. Though suppressed, these struggles inspired later national movements and showed the early spirit of freedom among the people of Tamil Nadu.',
